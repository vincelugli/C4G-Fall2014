<h3>About SNAP UP</h3>
<p>SNAP UP is an app you can use to find your nearest SNAP retailer. It also highlights retailers that are participating in the SNAP UP program, which offers a two-for-one discount on fresh produce.</p>
<br />
<p>The SNAP UP app was developed by the Georgia Tech Computing for Good class for Georgia Food Oasis.</p>
<br />
<p><a href="http://georgiafoodoasis.org/">Georgia Food Oasis</a>
is a program that helps communities develop innovative and affordable ways for residents to discover, taste, and learn about food. By working together, neighbors and community leaders can help community members shop smarter, eat healthier, and feel better. Through an Eat, Cook, Grow strategy, Food Oasis communities will enhance opportunities for residents to come together to cook up their own food future. We are a collaboration between 13 local organizations including the Atlanta Community Food Bank.</p>
